# IP-Grabber by Strepto 

~Instructions~
The program requires that you enter your details in the SendEmail class file or else it will do nothing. Please make sure you change those details before compiling into an exe or jar file. **You must also have a Java Runtime Environment installed**

This program was originally written to aid in the hosting of dedicated Minecraft servers. Due to our ISP restrictions we cannot give ourselves static external IP addresses. A friend of mine asked me to write a program that would periodically send him his current external IP address via email so he could update the server when needed. Please feel free to contribute to this program in any way you wish AS LONG AS IT IS NOT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. Imporvements to efficiency, adding a GUI or even adding extra features is welcome.
