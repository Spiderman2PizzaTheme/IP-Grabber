# IP-Grabber by Strepto 

This program was originally written to aid in the hosting of dedicated Minecraft servers. Due to our ISP restrictions we cannot give ourselves static external IP addresses. A friend of mine asked me to write a program that would periodically send him his current external IP address via email so he could update the server when needed. Please feel free to contribute to this program in any way you wish AS LONG AS IT IS NOT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. Imporvements to efficiency, adding a GUI or even adding extra features is welcome.
